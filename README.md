- This project originated as a final assignment for the Meta Advanced HTML and CSS course. While the requirement was to build a single landing page, I took the initiative to develop a full, multi-page responsive website to further demonstrate and solidify my skills in semantic HTML and advanced CSS layout techniques.

- A responsive, multi-page static website for the fictional 'Little Lemon' restaurant. Built with a focus on semantic HTML and advanced CSS layout techniques.
